 # rugby-wasm

 WebAssembly bindings for `rugby`.

## Build

Use a tool like [`wasm-pack`][bindgen] to compile and bundle Wasm bindings:

```
wasm-pack build
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> As `wasm-pack` has since been archived, I am looking for a suitable
> alternative. In the meantime, it is still the recommended solution.
