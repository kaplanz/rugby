# rugby-swift

Swift bindings for `rugby`.

## Build

Use the included [`Makefile`](./Makefile) to both compile and generate Swift
bindings:

```
make
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In order to compile [`rugby-ios`](../../apps/ios), you must first compile
> these bindings. This may eventually become automated within Xcode as a build
> step in the future.
