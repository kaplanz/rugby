Welcome to the iOS port of Rugby, my Game Boy emulator core. This project has
been in development for over five years, and it's exciting to be so close to
release.

GOALS
• Cycle-accurate Game Boy emulation.
• Support for DMG, SGB, and CGB models.

FEATURES
• Import any Game Boy ROM from your own collection.
• All data, ROMs, and saves stored locally as regular files.
• Sleek, modern interface that feels native on iOS.
• Customizable colour palettes and optional shader effects.
• Controller support through Apple's Game Controller framework.
• Fully open source and permissively licensed.

This is an early preview build and not yet feature-complete. By joining the
TestFlight, you'll help identify bugs and provide feedback to make Rugby the
best it can be.

Thank you for testing!
