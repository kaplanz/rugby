# rugby-core

This library implements the Game Boy emulator core. As the internal
implementation library, it is not intended to be used directly, rather it should
be used through the top-level [`rugby`](/) crate.

Currently, only the original Game Boy (DMG) is supported, although future
support for the Game Boy Color (CGB) is planned.
