[![dependency status][deps.badge]][deps.hyper]
[![cli frontend][cli.badge]](./apps/cli)

A cycle accurate emulator of the original 1989 Nintendo Game Boy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Consider this to be pre-alpha software. I make no guarantee of the stability
> of any documented APIs until the first official release.

## Goal

This project aims to provide high-accuracy emulation of all major components in
the SM83-based Nintendo Game Boy family of consoles. Each component is modular,
enabling them to be easily substituted for one another. In turn, this leads to
emulator instances supporting multiple implementations of core components with
different accuracy/performance margins.

> [!NOTE]
>
> At this time, there are no plans to support the later Game Boy Advance, which
> has an entirely different architecture.

## Organization

In accordance with the preference for modularity outlined above, the project is
partitioned into the [core](./core), the [debugger](./gbd), and various emulator
[frontends](./apps). Useful supporting [crates](./crates) are independently
available as well. Also packaged in this repository are several open-source
[ROMs](./roms). These are used internally for testing and to demo project
functionality.

### Workspace

Cargo — Rust's package manager — allows for a workspace of several crates to be
specified within its [manifest](./Cargo.toml). Within this project, workspace
crates are used with the structure as follows:

```
./
├── Cargo.lock       # cargo lockfile
├── Cargo.toml       # cargo manifest
├── Justfile         # useful development commands
├── README.md        # this document
├── ...
├── apps/            # frontend apps
├── arch/            # architecture primitives
├── core/            # emulation core
├── crates/          # support crates
├── docs/            # documentation
├── gbd/             # game boy debugger
├── roms/            # open-source ROMs
├── src/             # emulation library
└── tests/           # integration tests
```

> [!TIP]
>
> For downstream library users, I recommend using the top-level `rugby` crate
> rather than directly using `rugby-core`, as it better structured for end
> users and includes useful supporting modules.

### Components

Main components of `rugby` are outlined below.

- [`rugby`](./): is the high-level library that provides the public API.
- [`rugby-arch`](./arch): defines the architecture primitives for emulation.
- [`rugby-core`](./core): contains the implementation of emulator cores.
- [`rugby-gbd`](./gbd): provides an interactive prompt debugging interface.

#### Frontends

- [`rugby-cli`](./apps/cli): a command-line interface application with rich
  configuration support and comprehensive debugging options.

Several additional frontends are planned for the future:

- `rugby-ios`: a native iOS/macOS application, most likely using SwiftUI.
- `rugby-sdl`: a cross-platform application based upon the [SDL] framework.
- [`rugby-web`](./apps/web): an online hosted frontend powered by [Wasm].

## [Testing](./tests/README.md)

Rigorous integration testing is provided to validate the implementation and
prevent regressions in future versions.

This project would not have been possible without the countless Game Boy
community resources. Of these, I would like to specifically recognize the [Game
Boy Development community][gbdev].
